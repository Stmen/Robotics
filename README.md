Robot Kinematics application [c++]

This application use Matrix class, which can be use for any other operations on Matrix.

Achieved:
- Calculation of forward kinematics of robot using Denavitâ€“Hartenberg parameters.
- UI: User interface for data input

TODO:
- Calculation of inverse kinematics of robot
- Calculation of robot dynamics
